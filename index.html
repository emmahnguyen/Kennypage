		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img src = "mygamerpose.png" width = "505" height = "345"/>
		<p>Hello everyone!</p>
		<div>My name is Kenny Liu (劉德沅) and I am in my senior year as a CS student. Above is a picture of me walking at a friend's wedding that someone took and compared it to a gamer pose. A few things about me are that I enjoy baking, gaming, coding, and selling online. Below, I have shared my favorite website where I learn how to make a lot of delicious Chinese and Taiwanese desserts and pastries. I enjoy baking a lot of things such as 蛋塔 egg tarts, 馬拉糕 ma la gao, which is a steamed sweet sponge cake, 伍仁月餅, which are mooncakes with a variety of chopped nut fillings, and I also enjoy making 蛋黃酥, which are egg yolk pastries with red bean paste inside. The games I enjoy playing are Minecraft, Fortnite, and Genshin. For coding, I have my very own Discord meme bot coded in Python that sends funny memes retrieved from an API. All it takes is a command to make the bot send memes. Lastly, I sell a lot of old items that I no longer want so I can make a little profit in addition to being the freelance programmer. I hope to have another great semester and graduate in less than 1 year with my bachelors in computer science! </div>
